# Unit 4: Three-phase Power

[Q] A small industrial system consists of two balanced three-phase loads, “Load 1” and “Load 2”. They are supplied by three-phase power utility Vab = 400 V (rms, line-to-line), f = 50 Hz line, as shown in Figure Q1. Calculate: 

(a)  The total apparent power (S in VA) –per phase, of the combined load.    

(b)  The total reactive power compensation (Qc in kVAR, per-phase) of the three delta connected capacitors connect parallel with the load to raise the power factor (pf) to unity.    

(c)  The magnitude of the line current (|IL1|) without any power factor compensation, as in (a)  

(d)  The magnitude of the line current (|IL2|) considering the total reactive power compensation in to raise the power factor (pf) to unity, as in (b).
