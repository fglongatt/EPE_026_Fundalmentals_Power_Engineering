# Unit 2: Power Flow in Single Phase Steady-State AC systems

[Q] It is known that a particular load draws a current, which is 7.0 A when measured by the ammeter. Also, the current lags behind the voltage of 220 V by 30Â°. 

(a) Calculate the power factor (pf = cos(phi))     

(b) Calculate the real or active power (P in Watts) taken by the load.
