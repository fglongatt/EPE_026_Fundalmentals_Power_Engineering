# Unit 3: Introduction to Three-Phase Systems



[Q1] Figure Q1 shows a 120/sqrt(3)  aprox 208-V (line to line, rms voltage)  three-phase ideally balanced system. find: 
(a)  The magnitude and angle of the line current |IL| in phase a (in Amps)   
(b)  The magnitude of the loadâ€™s line and phase voltages VLL and VLN (as shown in Fig Q1)
